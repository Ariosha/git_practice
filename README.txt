Hello Git and GitHub!

Second commit! just edited the txt file, looking to find out how to edit it from the bash terminal!

Third commit, seems you cant. Also i'm very sick rn. For now it looks like you have to open the document and edit it before you commit it, cant just do it from the terminal 

Fourth commit, didn't get a job again today, guess ill be studying for the next 48 hours..

Fifth commit, learning java, Thinking i should make a discord music bot since Groovy got removed.
